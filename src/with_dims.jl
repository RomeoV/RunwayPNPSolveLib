    WithDims(q::Quantity)
    WithDims(u::Units)
Returns a subtype of [`Unitful.Quantity`](@ref) with the dimensions constrained to the
dimension of `q` or `u`.
Useful to build unitful interfaces that don't constrain the numeric type or the unit, just the dimension of a quantity.

Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> using Unitful, Unitful.DefaultSymbols; import Unitful.hr
julia> circumference_of_square(side::WithDims(m)) = 4*side;
julia> circumference_of_square((1//2)m)  # works
2//1 m
julia> circumference_of_square((1//2)km)  # also works
2//1 km
# You can also constrain the return type. The numeric type is usually inferred automatically.
julia> kinetic_energy(mass::WithDims(kg), velocity::WithDims(m/s))::WithDims(J) = mass*velocity^2;
julia> kinetic_energy(1000kg, 100km/hr)
10000000 kg km^2 hr^-2
```
